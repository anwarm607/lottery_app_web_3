Basic types:
string
bool
int
uint
address






Reference type:
Fixed array - unchanging length and single type - int[3] -> [0, 1,2]
                                                - bool[2] -> [true, false]
Dynamic array - single type but change in length -> int[] -> [1,2,3,4,5]
mapping - collection of key value pair like object in JS but same type -> 
        mapping(string => string), mapping(int => bool)

struct - same like mapping but can be different types -> 
        struct Car {
            string make;
            int modelNumber;
            bool isAvailable;
            string color;
        }



Common function types:
public - anyone can call this fn
private - only contract can call
view - can return data but does not modify the contract
constant - same as view
pure - can't read and modify the data of contract
payable - the user might pay for calling this fn.
